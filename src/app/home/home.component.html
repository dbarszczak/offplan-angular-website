        <p>During the boom years, thousands of people purchased " Off Plan Holiday Homes" or "Permanent Homes" throughout Spain and the Balearic Islands from Spanish developers.</p>

            knowing what happened to their "Deposit Money"</p>
        <p>Many Purchasers believed that if the developer entered into liquidation, or was forced into Bankruptcy, they would have no chance of reclaiming their lost deposits.</p>
